Worked for about 1 year and moved to a stationary place. Island Shop Anuwat, who at that time was the producer of Keta Records, came to meet and invited me to go to Bangkok. to test the sound but not pass So returned to work at the same place again.

About 3-4 months later, Aran Lertpipat , a Grammy Camp composer, met him and was interested and persuaded him, but Got didn't dare to admit it. Because he is not sure that it is true until Aran district has to take P. De Rewat Puttinan, co-founder and producer of GMM Grammy (at that time, the company's name was Grammy Entertainment).

The Grammys intended to make Got to be a "pop singer" . Got himself liked to be like P Bird - Thongchai McIntyre, but after singing it, he couldn't find a way out. Sometimes it will be as intended.

Until Janepop finished Prawanwan, suggested to sing an old song as a Luk Thung song. and made it into the Mae Mai Thai song project. There are many singers participating in the project, such as Nantida Kaewbuasai, Charas Fueng-rom, Pan Paiboonkiat Kheawkaew, Patra Tiwanon and Chakphan Aborkhonburi, bringing old songs from Amata to make arrangements to sing new songs to form. His own style, especially the Got that, Janaphop finished the process of Wan, selected the songs for him and controlled the production of every step by himself.


My Heart Is Empty - Chakphan Aborkhonburi

The name Got Chakphan Aborkhonburi was instantly recognized by a song. "My Heart Is Empty", an old song by Suraphon Sombatcharoen

De Rewat Puttinan's precise vision
In that era, international Thai music (strings) was more popular. Genre Folk Scottish propose that the camp. "Because he was young It's worth trying to do string music first. to match the market in this period," but Mr. Rewat Puttinan confirmed from the beginning that It's suitable for country music. But he did not object, saying, "You will be successful in singing luk thung because we can see, but if you want to try stringing it."

Thus was born the 2nd album "Got Shot" that changed the genre to a string, and the 3rd album "Got because the heart is not the same" is a comfortable song to listen to. But maybe because it's hard to listen to and doesn't stick to the ears, it's not very popular.

In 1995, they came back to consult each other again. I want to try to change it back to a style of country music, De Rewat Puttinan. I 'm very happy because I think it's the most suitable way It was at the same time that "Grammy Gold" was established as a new company in the group. by separating the production line for luk thung songs Coming out of the international line with Kris Tommas as managing director and one of the producers

got 06

The team therefore produces Shetland album "Gorton cherished" sets 1-5 (5 set out at once to stretch in the set) by Kris Tom Thomas is the producer's identity is Nottingham has since continued, even create multiple. album together But it was sold in an unprecedented landslide, about 2 million cartridges (at that time still selling but cassette tapes, no CDs) until it was considered an important turning point. who made his name and was born in the field of Lukthung (That popularity, even after 20 years, still produces a collection of hit albums that sell.)

The turning point in the history of luk thung music
This "Hua Kaew Hua Waen" event is considered a turning point in the history of the country music industry. Because there is a slight mix of Thai international music in the country music. Before that, Luk Thung had a clear musical instrument pattern. String music enthusiasts normally accept it. The people who are popular in country music At first there were conflicting opinions. But when published for a while It began to be popular and accepted in the end.

and later, this applied country music genre It has become a popular trend that can be found in the works of the next generation of artists, both this record label and other record labels. in a gradual manner mixed with more international Thainess

In 1995, the production team set the album "Got Hua Kaew Hua Waen" set 1-5 and in 1996 produced another set 6-9 , total sales of 9 sets were over 10 million. Toner success at this overwhelming Ter Rawat perception Noonan has warned Scott that "I have a great sense because of the success that comes with this. will distract us," which he has always cherished.

Because in the beginning of the album, Grammy Gold was not well versed and had experience in organizing the stage performances of luk thung songs. Besides singing He is also actively involved in the production of albums such as song selection, music selection. Providing accompaniment dancers (dancers) , costume production, accompaniment dancers, etc., became a way of working on all subsequent albums ( more recently, also in control of the music).

The case of the dancer's costume The manager he called "Phi Mod", who was a designer of " Alcazar" before, was responsible for procuring the costumes from Alcazar to modify for the dancers to wear. and emphasizes the grandeur of the show which has become so popular that it has become a form of stage performance where the popular country music bands come to perform Including every subsequent album of his own, he regarded his "gorgeous stage performance as the centerpiece of the album" because his fans loved it. as well as the development of more diverse music content thus increasing the variety of costumes and add more show styles, such as mixing styles of show "Broadway stage theater" of foreign countries, etc.
